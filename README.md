# GECCO 2020 code
Code for the GECCO 2020 submission

This repository contains the notebook used in order to reproduce the experiments and the results in the GECCO paper (not yet on arxiv to avoid conflicts with the double blind policy).

The notebook is split in parts which are referring to the paper.

A cleaner version of the code will be produced later and a requirement.txt will be provided to get the same environment.


In the meantime, do not hesitate to leave any comments you may have.

Thanks!
